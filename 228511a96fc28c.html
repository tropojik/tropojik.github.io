The explosive eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai created a sonic boom heard as far north as Alaska. It also triggered a tsunami that destroyed homes on nearby islands before crossing the ocean to the coasts of Japan and North and South America. The Hunga-Tonga eruption was so powerful that it sent a rare pressure wave rippling around the world. A Polynesian Kingdom, Tonga is composed of 169 South Pacific islands. Its population of just under 105,000 resides in one of 36 inhabited islands, with 70% of residents living on Tongatapu. New Zealands North Island is about 1,100 miles from Tonga. The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai volcano north of Tongatapu unexpectedly erupted on Jan. 14 Under the water of the ocean, a huge volcano has formed, at the northern edge of which volcanic eruptions have created two smaller islands: the Hunga Haapai Islands and the Hongga Tonga Islands. In 2015, an explosive volcanic eruption connected the two continents and after that they became an island.January 17, 2022. On January 15, the volcano violently erupted, wiping the island of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai off the map. The forces which had joined two islands as one, had torn them apart. Some floating pumice, but no sign of the island here on January 17.

Courtesy of NASA Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitoring Page via Simon Carn.Recovery efforts from the 14-15 January eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai continued in Tonga. According to a news article, the main undersea international fiber-optic communication cable that had been severed in multiple places due to the eruption had been repaired by 21 February, and internet connectivity was restored by 22 February.By any measure you want to use, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai volcano eruption in January 2022 was a massive eruption.. It produced a swirling plume of gas, dust and ash that reached 58 kilometers (36 miles) into the sky, atmospheric waves that traveled around the globe several times, and tsunamis in the Caribbean on the other side of the world.In early 2015, a volcanic eruption in the Kingdom of Tonga created a new island informally known as Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha&apos;apai (HTHH). The subsequent evolution of the new island was previously described in &quot;The Birth of a New Island&quot; available here . Below are additional visualizations, including an updated view of the island&apos;s appearance in March 2018 as well as some visualizations of the The United States continues to increase its assistance to the Kingdom of Tonga in the wake of the recent Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai volcanic eruptions, ashfall, and tsunami. As announced yesterday, the United States will provide, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), an additional $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by this disaster. []Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai volcano in the SW Pacific is 65 km NW of the island of Tongatapu, where the capital of the Kingdom of Tonga, Nukualofa, is located. It lies 2,000 km N of New Zealand and over 3,000 km NE of Australia. Several submarine volcanoes along the Tofua arc are shown in red triangles.In 2018, there were three primary patches of vegetation: two in depositional areas to the NW and SW of the cone (near the pre-existing Hunga Ha&apos;apai island), and one on the western flank of the cone itself. Last year, the NW patch was heavily dominated by near mono-culture of beach morning glory, but this year was host to a much more diverse It has been estimated that the eruption was the equivalent of around 10 megatons of TNT. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai first formed between Dec. 2014 and Jan. 2015, when the previously underwater volcano erupted. When all the dust, rock, and ash settled, a newly-formed island remained between two older islands, with a summit reaching 400 feet high.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai eruption was also the strongest reversal that Swarm has ever seen, and ICON just happened to have the right timing and positioning to catch it. What ICON beamed back to terra firma showed that there was extreme turbulence in the ionosphere. Its observations were close to previous predictions of how the upper The digital elevation maps above and below show the dramatic changes at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai, the uppermost part of a large underwater volcano. It rises 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) from the seafloor, stretches 20 kilometers (12 miles) across, and is topped by a submarine caldera 5 kilometers in diameter. The island is part of the rim of The ~ 150 meter tall volcanic island, hereafter referred to as Hunga Tonga Hunga Haapai (HTHH), was formed by hydro-volcanic eruption processes leading to the construction of a classical tephra cone volcano with flank pyroclastic flows.The violent eruption of Tonga&apos;s Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai volcano injected an unprecedented amount of water directly into the stratosphere and the vapor will stay there for years, likelyThe digital elevation maps above and below show the dramatic changes at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai, the uppermost part of a large underwater volcano.

Tonga enters lockdown after first community transmitted COVID-19 cases detected. February 3, 2022 by Peter Granitz, NPR News.Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai (HT-HH), a submarine volcano in the South Pacific (20.54S, 175.38W), reached its climactic eruption phase on 15 January 2022. The blast sent a volcanic plume into the mesosphere to altitudes of up to 57 kma record in the satellite era (Carr et al., 2022; Proud et al., 2022 ).One factor for why the water vapor from Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai might add to environment effects in the short-term is that water vapor that gets to the air usually develops from Planets exotic areas and after that ices up. This produces a quantifiable and also foreseeable pattern noticeable as a tape recorder signal seen in the picture.On 15 January 2022, the underwater Hunga TongaHunga Haapai volcano erupted between two uninhabited islands in the South Pacifics Kingdom of Tonga. The one-in-a-thousand-year blast, whose NASA scientists say. The massive amount of water vapor is roughly 10% of the normal amount of vapor found in the stratosphere, equaling more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools.Thank you Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai for your unearthly beauty and for helping us better understand the workings of our Earth and other planets beyond it. I cant wait to return. Grace Callahan, Wellesley College. On this expedition to the Kingdom of Tonga, NASA is partnering with the Tongan Ministry of the Environment and the Sea Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha&apos;apai reach an elevation of only 149 m and 128 m above sea level, respectively, and display inward-facing sea cliffs with lava and tephra layers dipping gently away from the submarine caldera. A rocky shoal 3.2 km SE of Hunga Ha&apos;apai and 3 km south of Hunga Tonga marks the most prominent historically active vent.13 January eruption. NOAAs GOES-17 satellite captured the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai volcano on 13 January 2022 (Figure 1). The extent of the ash plume can be seen, as well as multiple rippling gravity waves emanating outward. Gravity waves are generated, similarly to convective events, by an energetic density fluctuation Stereo methods using GOES-17 and Himawari-8 applied to the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai volcanic plume on 15 January 2022 show overshooting tops reaching 5055 km altitude, a record in the The January 2022 Hunga TongaHunga Haapai eruption was one of the most explosive volcanic events of the modern era 1,2, producing a vertical plume which peaked > 50km above the Earth 3. TheFollowing the 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai eruption, several trace gases measured by the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) displayed anomalous stratospheric values. Trajectories and radiance simulations confirm that the H 2 O, SO 2, and HCl enhancements were injected by the eruption.Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos; apai is a submarine volcano in the South Pacific located about 30 km (19 mi) south of the submarine volcano of Fonuafoou and 65 km (40 mi) north of Tongatapu, Tonga&apos;s main island.Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai Volcanic Eruption. NEAR TONGA | On January 14th and January 15, 2022 an underwater volcano erupted near Tonga sending a plume of ash, gas and steam upwards of 30 km (~18.6 mi) into the atmosphere and tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. Prior eruptions had been reported in December 2021.The name Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha&apos;apai refers to the two islands of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Haapai that were merged as a result of the submarine volcano breaching sea level due to an eruption. The two islands are the remnants of the western and northern rim of the volcano&apos;s caldera. It is located about 65km north of Nukualofa, the capital of Tonga.Proper noun. Hunga Tonga - Hunga Ha&apos;apai. A seamount and volcano in Tonga, Oceania, in the Tonga archipelago, Polynesia, Pacific ocean, that has two peaks that become the islets of Hunga Tonga and Hunga Ha&apos;apai. A former island in Tonga, on the seamount; formed from a new cinder cone that rose in the strait between the islands of Hunga Tonga But the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai eruption caused so much water vapor to enter the atmosphere that this pattern is disrupted. That may lead to excess water vapor arriving over northern mid-latitudes at about 18 months and in the southern mid-latitudes in about two years, with previous research demonstrating how excess water vapor in the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&apos;apai Volcano Eruption Watch on On January 15th 2022, an underwater volcano erupted in the South Pacific Ocean blasting steam, ash, and sulfur dioxide to record heights. The explosive eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai created a sonic boom heard as far north as Alaska.The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haapai eruption on Jan. 15, 2022, caused many effects, some illustrated here, that were felt around the world and even into space. Some of those effects, like extreme winds and unusual electric currents were picked up by NASAs ICON mission and ESAs (the European Space Agency) Swarm.
